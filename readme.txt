NOT COMPLETED: none;

CHALLENGES:
	- Initial learning curve.
	- Had trouble with printing function
		- was looking for a function to send texts to browser's built-in printer dialog
		- found a lot of .NET doucmentation of printing function, but they were for windows app, not website. E.g. PrintDocument function in C# is too complicated and trying to actually do the printing job
		- searched for javascript functions, very easy to print whole page, but a lot more trouble to print just a section
		- found Jquery.print plugin 
	- Struggled a little to run jQuery functions on button click
